## Implementation Strategy

To implement these improvements effectively:

1. Start with high-impact items that affect core user experience
2. Implement improvements incrementally to avoid regression
3. Test each enhancement across different devices and browsers
4. Gather feedback after implementing each major feature
5. Prioritize accessibility throughout the process

This plan serves as a living document and should be updated as improvements are implemented and new ideas emerge.
